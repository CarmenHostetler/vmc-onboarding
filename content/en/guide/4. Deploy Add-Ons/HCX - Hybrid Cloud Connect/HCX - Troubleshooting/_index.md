  How to troubleshoot HCX for VMware Cloud on AWS

## Introduction

## What is VMware Hybrid Cloud Extension (HCX)?

VMware HCX®, an application mobility platform, simplifies application migration, workload rebalancing and business continuity across data centers and clouds. HCX enables high-performance, large-scale app mobility across VMware vSphere® and non-vSphere cloud and on-premises environments to accelerate data center modernization and cloud transformation. HCX automates the creation of an optimized network interconnect and extension, and facilitates interoperability across KVM, Hyper-V and vSphere 5.0+ to current vSphere versions. This delivers live and bulk migration capabilities without redesigning the application or re-architecting networks.

### Why VMware HCX?

As organizations adopt hybrid and multi-cloud architectures leveraging VMware infrastructure, they stand up new environments locally and in the cloud to simplify operations and increase business agility. However, the promise of a modern data center or hybrid cloud can’t be realized until applications and workloads exist in these new environments. VMware HCX enables data center and cloud transformations by simplifying the process of populating and continually optimizing application placement on modern VMware infrastructure.

HCX unlocks the potential of new environments based on vSphere by building  an abstraction layer that links on-premises data centers and clouds. This hybrid interconnect tethers sites so networks can automatically stretch securely across  sites, enabling seamless mobility of virtual machines (VMs). HCX enables hybrid capabilities in VMware vCenter® to allow for application migration to populate  newly available infrastructure, workload rebalancing for ongoing optimization of  cloud and local resources, and simplified disaster recovery by eliminating the  need for network provisioning and configuration.

### Use Cases

#### Application Migration

Accelerate data center modernization with VMware HCX. Automatically create  a hybrid interconnect to easily migrate thousands of vSphere and non-vSphere  VMs within and across data centers and clouds without requiring reboot. Once migrated, swing networks without any retrofit/redesign.

#### Workload Rebalancing

Move workloads at any time to meet scale, cost management, compliance and  vendor neutrality goals. Actively rebalance your cloud and on-premises application footprint with HCX as an always-on, secure, high-throughput, WAN-optimized,  hybrid interconnect that tethers cloud to on-premises estates for on-demand migration, data center extension and cloud bursting.

#### Business Continuity and Disaster Protection

Leverage the HCX hybrid interconnect and rapid migration capabilities to protect workloads by replicating data across common VMware infrastructure in two or more places. Back up critical workloads on demand, or schedule for disaster recovery planning seamlessly and securely with no reconfiguration of IPs. HCX now integrates with VMware Site Recovery Manager™ for advanced use cases.

- Interconnect (IX) Tunnel - Handles migration traffic.
- Network Extension (NE) Tunnel - Handles L2 Network Extensions communications.

### HCX with Direct Connect (DX) in VMware Cloud on AWS

#### Introduction

By default when HCX is deployed in a VMware Cloud on AWS SDDC, it automatically provisions public IP addresses for the traffic to transverse through the public internet.

If a company decides to use an AWS Direct Connect line, this may not be the preferred method for traffic to flow. HCX traffic can be re-directed over a Direct Connect private line for a more secure, more private way of migration and L2 traffic to flow through.

#### Pre-requisites

- An AWS Direct Connect must be ordered and deployed.
- HCX must be activated from the VMC SDDC console.
- An additional private subnet (internal RFC 1918, non-overlapping subnet).
  - Size of subnet is dependent of how many appliances will need to be deployed.
  - For a typical deployemnt, 2 IP addresses are needed, or a minimum of a /29 or /28 or greater is recommended.

#### Change HCX Cloud Resolution

![DX 1](https://vmc-onboarding-images.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/HCX/HCX27.jpg)

1. Click on Settings tab.
2. Under HCX Information click Edit.

![DX 2](https://vmc-onboarding-images.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/HCX/HCX28.jpg)

1. Change Resolution to Private IP.
2. Click SAVE.

![DX 3](https://vmc-onboarding-images.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/HCX/HCX29.jpg)

1. Click Interconnect.
2. Click Network Profiles.
3. Click EDIT on directConnectNetwork1 Network Profile.

![DX 4](https://vmc-onboarding-images.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/HCX/HCX30.jpg)

1. Enter IP range to use.
2. Enter prefix length.
3. Enter Default Gateway.
4. Click UPDATE button.

After a few minutes, validate that this new segment is advertised over the Direct Connect in VMC SDDC Console. Networking & Security tab -> System -> Direct Connect. The subnet should be visible under Advertised BGP Routes.

Once the new subnet is visible under Advertised BGP Routes, you may need to accept the route advertisement on your on-premises BGP peer.

Ensure that if any Firewall is in between, port UDP 4500 will be needed to be opened between on-premises appliances and this new CIDR range.

When creating your Service Mesh on-premises, you should select this Network Profile (directConnectNetwork1) as the Destination Site Uplink Network Profile.
