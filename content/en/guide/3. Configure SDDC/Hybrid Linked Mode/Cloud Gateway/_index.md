---
In this guide we will be configuring the Cloud Gateway Appliance to setup Hybrid Linked Mode

![CGW Overview](https://vmc-onboarding-images.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3.Configure-SDDC/hybrid-linked-mode/cloud-gateway/cgwoverview.png)

## Pre-Reqs:
- Your on-prem vCenter needs to be:
  - vSphere 6.0 Updatge 3 patch c or later
  - vSphere 6.5 patch d or later

- NTP: Tolerate a time skew of up to 10 minuets
- A VPN or a Direct Connect exists
- Max Latency: 100 msec roundtrip
- An On-Prem AD group which will be assigned Cloud Administrator Permmisions
- Login credentials for a user who has a minimum of read-only access to the Based DN for uses and groups in your AD
- On-premises DNS server configured
- Cloud vCenter resolution should be set to resolve Private IP
- On-Premises Firewall allows required ports 
- Management Firewall on the cloud side allows required ports
- Ensure that you have the admin credentials for your on-premises vSphere SSO domain 

The following are the ports that you will need opened on both your Management Gateway Firewall in VMware Cloud on AWS and you on-prem Firewall.
