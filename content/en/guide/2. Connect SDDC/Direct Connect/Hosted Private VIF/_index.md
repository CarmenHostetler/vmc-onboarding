###	Direct Connection Service Type

-	Public VIF – Leverages Public IP Addresses / Public BGP Autonomous System Number (ASN) since it is traditionally used to connect to AWS’ publicly accessible services (i.e. Amazon S3 Simple Storage Service).
- Private VIF – Leverages Private IP Addresses / Private BGP Autonomous System Number (ASN) to connect to a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment.

###	AWS Connection Name 
- Arbitrary name for the DX connection being deployed; this will be displayed in the VMware Cloud on AWS Console.
### AWS Account ID 
- This is a numerical account identification that is associated with the AWS Account that VMware owns and uses to support the customer’s VMware Cloud on AWS SDDC environment:


## Click on Networking and Security Tab, then go to Direct Connect in the left menu. 

Copy the AWS Account ID
