Try answering these questions for your user in this page:

## Key terms and concepts?

VPC - Virtual Priate Cloud

## Why do I want it?

Help your user know if your project will help them. Useful information can include: 

* **What is it good for?**: What types of problems does your project solve? What are the benefits of using it?

* **What is it not good for?**: For example, point out situations that might intuitively seem suited for your project, but aren't for some reason. Also mention known limitations, scaling issues, or anything else that might let your users know if the project is not for them.

* **What is it *not yet* good for?**: Highlight any useful features that are coming soon.

## Where should I go next?

Give your users next steps from the Overview. For example:

* [Getting Started](/getting-started/): Get started with $project
* [Examples](/examples/): Check out some example code!
